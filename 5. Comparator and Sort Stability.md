**Comparator interface:** Sort using an alternate order


```java
public interface Comparator<Key> {
	int compare(Key v, Key w);
}
```

> To use with Java system sort:
* Create Comparator object
* Pass as second argument to Arrays.sort()

**eg:** 
```java
String[] a;
...
Arrays.sort(a);
Arrays.sort(a, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);
Arrays.sort(a, Collator.getInstance(new Locale("es"))); // uses alternate order defined by Comparator<String> object
```
<br>
<br>
<br>

**Sorting stability:** A stable sort preserves the relative order of items with equal keys, especially in the case that when sort by primary key, the second key is still sorted.

Q. Which sorts are stable? (check items in the "<" and "<=" cases)<br>
A. Insertion sort(Equal items never move past each other, stop when left <= right); Mergesort(depends on implementation, to be stable, when meets equal keys, takes from left subarray)
<br>
<br>
Q. Which sorts are NOT stable? (use counterexample)<br>
A. Selection sort(Long-distance exchange might move an item past some equal item); Shellsort(Long-distance exchange)
