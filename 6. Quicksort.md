### Quicksort 
* **Time Complexity:** Average->O(NlogN); Worse->O(N^2), when array is already sorted 
* 39% more compares than mergesort but faster than mergesort in practice because of less data movement.
* **Space Complexity:** total O(log(N)), O(1) for partitioning, O(log(N)) for recursive stacks!
* Java sort for primitive types 
* C qsort, Unix, Visual C++


**Quicksort partitioning process:**

* Phase 1: Repeat until i and j pointers cross.
	* Scan i from left to right so long as (a[i] < a[lo]).
	* Scan j from right to left so long as (a[j] > a[lo]).
 	* Exchange a[i] with a[j].
* Phase 2: When pointers cross.
	* Exchange a[lo] with a[j].
